NTP
	COMMANDS
		ntp server (ip address)
			Configure at client to point to NTP server.
		ntp master
			Configure current device to be NTP server.
			Default stratum is 8. The lower the stratum, the closer it is to the time source.
		ntp peer (ip address)
SWITCHING
	MTU FRAME SIZES
				SIZE
		NORMAL MTU	1500 BYTES
		JUMBO		9216 BYTES
		BABY GIANT	1600 BYTES
		RUNT		LESS THAN 64 BYTES (BAD FCS)
		COMMANDS
			system mtu (bytes) global
				Change MTU sizes on Ethernet/Fast Ethernet interfaces
			system mtu jumbo (bytes) global
				Change MTU sizes on Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.
	FRAME PROCESSING
		STORE-AND-FORWARD
			Switch stores entire frame and checks FCS to determine data corruption before forwarding
		FRAGMENTFREE
			Switch stores first 64 bytes of the frame and checks for data corruption before forwarding.	
		CUT-THROUGH
			Switch forwards frame even before frame have been received. No error detection is done.
	CONTENT ADDRESSABLE MEMORY (CAM) TABLE
		Stores information of incoming frames (source MAC addresses, switch port the frame arrived on, associated VLAN parameter.)
IP ROUTING
	GATEWAY OF LAST RESORT
		If no routes can be found for a packet, a router will forward it to the gateway of last resort.
		COMMANDS
			ip default-gateway
			ip default-network
			ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
	ADMINISTRATIVE DISTANCE
		Connected		0
		Static			1
		External BGP		20 (Different AS)
		EIGRP			90
		OSPF			110
		RIP			120
		External EIGRP		170 (Different routing protocols that inject their routes into EIGRP routing table)
		Internal BGP 		200 (Same AS)
	ROUTE SWITCHING
		PROCESS SWITCHING
			Look up all the routes and send packets to the one identified.
		FAST SWITCHING
			Cache routes after packet is sent and route following packets to same route.
			*Does not work if routing is not configured.
		CISCO EXPRESS FORWARDING
			Cache routes after packet is sent and route following packets to same route.
			Changes cache according to network topology.
			*Does not work if routing is not configured.
	LOST ROUTE/ROUTE POISONING
		When routers go down, routes can be lost.
		Route poisoning allows for dead routers to send high metric routes to tell other routers that it is a lost route.
	POISON REVERSE
		Distance vector routing protocols uses a poison reverse, a route poisoning technique.
		The purpose of this technique is to reduce routing loops.
		1. Router B informs Router A that one of its gateway is down with a metric of 16.
		2. Router A then replies Router B that Router B has one gateway with a metric of 16. (Poison Reverse)
	PASSIVE INTERFACE
		PROTOCOL		RECEIVE		SEND
		RIP			YES		NO
		EIGRP			NO		NO
		OSPF			NO		NO
	ETC
		* in routing tables refer to default route candidate. (i.e. route that is not configured as default route but chosen to be one.)
PORT SECURITY
	PORT VIOLATION STATES
		PROTECT
			Drop packets but does not increase security violation counter.
		RESTRICT
			Drop packets + SNMP message + increase security violation counter.
		SHUTDOWN
			Shutdown > err-disabled state
VLAN
	VOICE VLAN
		A port can allow for a second VLAN on an access port called the Voice VLAN
		Used to layer voice traffic atop data traffic.
	ISL/802.1q
		ISL is cisco proprietary while 802.1q is an IEEE standard
		ISL encapsulates the entire frame while 802.1q inserts a 12 bit field in the frame to identify the VLAN.
	INTERVLAN ROUTING ON A L3 SWITCH
		1. ip routing
		2. int vlan x > ip address x y
	COMMANDS
		int > switchport mode access
			*negotiates to convert a trunk link to a non trunk link
			Stops generating DTP frames when connected to a host?
		int > switchport nonegotiate
			prevents interface from generating DTP frames.
	SHOW COMMANDS
		show vlan
		show interfaces trunk
		show int (int) switchport
VTP
	BENEFITS
		Allows for consistent VLAN configuration across all switches in the network.
		VLAN trunking over mixed network such as Ethernet to ATM LANE or FDDI
		Accurate tracking and monitoring of VLANs
	COMMANDS
		vtp mode server
		vtp domain (domain name)
		vtp password (password)
	SHOW COMMANDS
		sh vtp status
	REQUIREMENTS
		VTP version must be the same
		VTP management domain name must be the same
		One switch has to be configured as a VTP server
		If a VTP password is used, all switches have to use a VTP password
	MODES
		Server/Client/Transparent
	VTP PRUNING
		COMMANDS
			switchport trunk pruning vlan (x-x)
IPV6
	COMMON IPV6 ADDRESSES
		::1		Loopback address
		2000::/3	Global unicast address range
		FC00::/7	Unique local unicast range
		FE80::/10	Link-local unicast range
		FF00::/8	Multicast range
		2002::/16	Used for 6-to-4 tunneling. Allows for IPv6 packets to be transmitted over IPv4 network without configuring explicit tunnels.
	IPV6 HEADER
		Version:	Contains IP version
		Traffic Class:	Equivalent of Type of Service field in IPv4
		Flow Label:	New field from IPV4. Used to mark packets and traffic flow. A flow is a sequence of packets from a single source to destination
		Payload Length:	Describe length of payload. (IPv4 defines the length of the entire packet)
		Next Header:	Define next header to be read (IPv4 demands static headers with each packet)
		Hop Limit:	Specifies the maxinum number of hops the IPv6 can traverse
		Source Address
		Destination Address
		
		DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IPV4 PACKETS
			Internet Header Length field removed as IPv6 header is fixed at 40 bytes.
			Flag fields needed for fragmentation is removed as fragmentation is processed differently.
			Header Checksum field removed as Data Link layer technologies already perform checksum and error control, which forces formerly optional upper-layer checksums (i.e. UDP) to become mandatory.
	ICMPV6 TYPES
		1	Destination Unreachable
		128	Echo Request
		129	Echo Reply
		133	Router Solicitation
		134	Router Advertisement
		135	Neighbor Solicitation
		136	Neighbor Advertisement
OSI
	LAYER 2 FRAME FORMAT
		PREAMBLE | START OF FRAME DELIMITER | DESTINATION ADDRESS | SOURCE ADDRESS | TYPE | DATA | FCS
		The preamble field is used to notify receiving hosts that a frame is being sent.
		The SOF field is used for synchronization with other hosts on the LAN.
		The type field indicates the protocol that is intended to receive the frame data after processing.
TELNET

		Ctrl+Shift+6 > x
			Exit telnet while maintaining telnet session.
			x
				Resume connection to session x
			resume x
				Resume connection to session x
		enable > terminal monitor
