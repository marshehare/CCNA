IP ROUTING
	ADMINISTRATIVE DISTANCE
		Connected		0
		Static			1
		External BGP		20 (Different AS)
		EIGRP			90
		OSPF			110
		RIP			120
		External EIGRP		170 (Different routing protocols that inject their routes into EIGRP routing table)
		Internal BGP 		200 (Same AS)
IPV6
	COMMON IPV6 ADDRESSES
		::1		Loopback address
		2000::/3	Global unicast address range
		FC00::/7	Unique local unicast range
		FE80::/10	Link-local unicast range
		FF00::/8	Multicast range
		2002::/16	Used for 6-to-4 tunneling. Allows for IPv6 packets to be transmitted over IPv4 network without configuring explicit tunnels.
	IPV6 HEADER
		Version:	Contains IP version
		Traffic Class:	Equivalent of Type of Service field in IPv4
		Flow Label:	Used to mark packets and traffic flow. A flow is a sequence of packets from a single source to destination
		Payload Length:	Describe length of payload. (IPv4 defines the length of the entire packet)
		Next Header:	Define next header to be read (IPv4 demands static headers with each packet)
		Hop Limit:	Specifies the maxinum number of hops the IPv6 can traverse
		Source Address
		Destination Address
		
		DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IPV4 PACKETS
			Internet Header Length field removed as IPv6 header is fixed at 40 bytes.
			Flag fields needed for fragmentation is removed as fragmentation is processed differently.
			Header Checksum field removed as Data Link layer technologies already perform checksum and error control, which forces formerly optional upper-layer checksums (i.e. UDP) to become mandatory.
