IP ROUTING
	ADMINISTRATIVE DISTANCE
		Connected		0
		Static			1
		External BGP		20 (Different AS)
		EIGRP			90
		OSPF			110
		RIP			120
		External EIGRP		170 (Different routing protocols that inject their routes into EIGRP routing table)
		Internal BGP 		200 (Same AS)
	ROUTE SWITCHING
		PROCESS SWITCHING
			Look up all the routes and send packets to the one identified.
		FAST SWITCHING
			Cache routes after packet is sent and route following packets to same route.
		CISCO EXPRESS FORWARDING
			Cache routes after packet is sent and route following packets to same route.
			Changes cache according to network topology.
	LOST ROUTE/ROUTE POISONING
		When routers go down, routes can be lost.
		Route poisoning allows for dead routers to send high metric routes to tell other routers that it is a lost route.
	ETC
		* in routing tables refer to default route candidate. (i.e. route that is not configured as default route but chosen to be one.)
PORT SECURITY
	PORT VIOLATION STATES
		PROTECT
			Drop packets
		RESTRICT
			Drop packets + SNMP message
		SHUTDOWN
			Shutdown > err-disabled state
VLAN
	VOICE VLAN
		A port can allow for a second VLAN on an access port called the Voice VLAN
		Used to layer voice traffic atop data traffic.
	ISL/802.1q
		ISL is cisco proprietary while 802.1q is an IEEE standard
		ISL encapsulates the entire frame while 802.1q inserts a 12 bit field in the frame to identify the VLAN.
	INTERVLAN ROUTING ON A L3 SWITCH
		1. ip routing
		2. int vlan x > ip address x y
	COMMANDS
		int > switchport mode access
			*negotiates to convert a trunk link to a non trunk link
		int > switchport nonegotiate
			prevents interface from generating DTP frames.
	SHOW COMMANDS
		show vlan
		show interfaces trunk
		show int (int) switchport
VTP
	BENEFITS
		Allows for consistent VLAN configuration across all switches in the network.
		VLAN trunking over mixed network such as Ethernet to ATM LANE or FDDI
		Accurate tracking and monitoring of VLANs
	COMMANDS
		vtp mode server
		vtp domain (domain name)
		vtp password (password)
	SHOW COMMANDS
		sh vtp status
	REQUIREMENTS
		VTP version must be the same
		VTP management domain name must be the same
		One switch has to be configured as a VTP server
		If a VTP password is used, all switches have to use a VTP password
	MODES
		Server/Client/Transparent
	VTP PRUNING
		COMMANDS
			switchport trunk pruning vlan (x-x)
IPV6
	COMMON IPV6 ADDRESSES
		::1		Loopback address
		2000::/3	Global unicast address range
		FC00::/7	Unique local unicast range
		FE80::/10	Link-local unicast range
		FF00::/8	Multicast range
		2002::/16	Used for 6-to-4 tunneling. Allows for IPv6 packets to be transmitted over IPv4 network without configuring explicit tunnels.
	IPV6 HEADER
		Version:	Contains IP version
		Traffic Class:	Equivalent of Type of Service field in IPv4
		Flow Label:	Used to mark packets and traffic flow. A flow is a sequence of packets from a single source to destination
		Payload Length:	Describe length of payload. (IPv4 defines the length of the entire packet)
		Next Header:	Define next header to be read (IPv4 demands static headers with each packet)
		Hop Limit:	Specifies the maxinum number of hops the IPv6 can traverse
		Source Address
		Destination Address
		
		DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IPV4 PACKETS
			Internet Header Length field removed as IPv6 header is fixed at 40 bytes.
			Flag fields needed for fragmentation is removed as fragmentation is processed differently.
			Header Checksum field removed as Data Link layer technologies already perform checksum and error control, which forces formerly optional upper-layer checksums (i.e. UDP) to become mandatory.
	ICMPV6 TYPES
		1	Destination Unreachable
		128	Echo Request
		129	Echo Reply
		133	Router Solicitation
		134	Router Advertisement
		135	Neighbor Solicitation
		136	Neighbor Advertisement
TELNET
	COMMANDS
		Ctrl+Shift+6 > x
			Exit telnet while maintaining telnet session.
		enable > terminal monitor
			Enable logging to show on telnet session
