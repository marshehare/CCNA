SLA
	Used to measure performance of network.
	COMMANDS
		ip sla x
			icmp-echo (ip address)
			frequency (x seconds to send packet)
		ip sla schedule x life (x seconds/forever) start-time (after/hh:mm/hh:mm:ss/now/pending)
	SHOW COMMANDS
		show ip sla configuration
		show ip sla statistics
	ETC
		Schedule must be set for icmp-echo to be used.
STP
	CHARACTERISTICS
		802.1d
			Older protocol
			50 seconds convergence time
		802.1w
			Never protocol
		PVST+
			Cisco proprietary
			Runs a separate 802.1d instance per VLAN
			Adds a 12 bit extended system ID to BPDU
		Rapid PVST+
			Cisco proprietary
			Runs a separate 802.1w instance per VLAN
			Backwards compatible
			Changes port states from Disabled/Blocking/Listening/Learning/Forwarding >> Discarding/Discarding/Discarding/Learning/Forwarding
			DESIGNATED PORT ELECTION
				Lowest path cost > lowest BID > port priority > lowest port number
	PATH COST
		10 Mb/s		100
		100 Mb/s	19
		1000 Mb/s	4
		10000 Mb/s	2
	ROOT BRIDGE ELECTION
		Check lowest BID (Priority + MAC Address)
	BPDU
		Each switch comapres the parameters (BID) in the BPDU for configuration of the network.
	PORT ROLES
		Root port
		Designated port
		Non-designated port
		Blocked port
			Still listens to BPDUs but drop all other frames.
		Forwarding port
		Alternate port
			Used by 802.1w
		Backup port
			Used by 802.1w
	PORT STATES
		Disabled
		Blocking
		Listening
			Listen to BPDUs prepares to forward data frames without populating MAC address table
		Learning
			Listen to BPDUs and is learning the paths in the switch network.
			Preparing to forward data frames and is populating MAC address table.
			The delay from "Listening" to "Learning" states is called "Forward Delay" (15s by default.)
		Forwarding
	PORTFAST/BPDUGUARD
		PORTFAST
			PortFast makes port transition from blocking to forwarding immediately.
			This can prevent DHCP problems (i.e. Host not being able to receive DHCP address due to slow convergence)
		BPDUGUARD
			BPDU Guard should be enabled along with PortFast
			Makes port that receive BPDUs to go into shutdown state, preventing switching loops from happening.
		COMMANDS
			spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
	COMMANDS
		spanning-tree vlan (x) priority (x)
		spanning-tree vlan (x) root (primary/secondary)
		spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
	SHOW COMMANDS
		sh spanning-tree
		sh spanning-tree summary
ETHERCHANNEL
	LACP
		IEEE 802.3ad
	PAgP
		Cisco proprietary
	REQUIREMENTS
		Same speed
		Same duplex
		Same VLAN info
	COMMANDS
		int port-channel (channel)
			Parameters (i.e. encapsulation dot1q) configured here are inherited on the interface level.
		int > channel-group (channel) mode (active/passive & desirable/auto)
	SHOW COMMANDS
		sh etherchannel port-channel
		sh etherchannel summary
	ETC
		When configuring switch-router port channels, ip address should be assigned to the interface port channel.
VLAN
	COMMANDS
		int > switchport mode access
			*negotiates to convert a trunk link to a non trunk link
		int > switchport nonegotiate
			prevents interface from generating DTP frames.
	SHOW COMMANDS
		show vlan
		show interfaces trunk
		show int (int) switchport
VTP
	BENEFITS
		Allows for consistent VLAN configuration across all switches in the network.
		VLAN trunking over mixed network such as Ethernet to ATM LANE or FDDI
		Accurate tracking and monitoring of VLANs
	COMMANDS
		vtp mode server
		vtp domain (domain name)
		vtp password (password)
	SHOW COMMANDS
		sh vtp status
	REQUIREMENTS
		VTP version must be the same
		VTP management domain name must be the same
		One switch has to be configured as a VTP server
		If a VTP password is used, all switches have to use a VTP password
	MODES
		Server/Client/Transparent
	VTP PRUNING
		COMMANDS
			switchport trunk pruning vlan (x-x)
