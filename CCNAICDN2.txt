HSRP
	Used to configure multiple physical routers to appear as a single logical one.
	Load balancing can be achieved by using multiple VLANs and assigning a specific router to a VLAN.
	The router will the higher HSRP priority will be elected as the active router (default 100 priority)
	If the priority is the same, the tiebreaker will the highest IP address.
	STATES
		1. Init
		2. Learn
		3. Listen
			All routers other than the active and standby routers will be in the listening state.
		4. Speak
			If another router with a higher priority becomes the active router, the preempt router will be in speak state and transition to listen/standby state after it determines its standing in the group.
		5. Standby
		6. Active
			Router is chosen as the active router.
	VIRTUAL HSRP IP ADDRESS
		e.g. 0000.0c07.ac0a
		The first 24 bits (0000.0c) are the vendor ID. HSRP being a cisco protocol, the ID is assigned to cisco.
		The next 16 bits (07.ac) are the well known HSRP ID.
		The last 8 bits (0a) are variable bits and represent the HSRP group number that it is assigned to. In this case, it is group 10 which is converted to hexadec.
	COMMANDS
		int x
			standby (group number) ip x
			standby (group number) preempt
				Needed to activate HSRP when active router goes down.
			standby (group number) name x
			standby (group number) priority x

		HUB AND SPOKE
			RECHABILITY ISSUES
				With distance vector routing protocols, reachability issues may result from split horizon.
				To solve this, you can disable split horizon (may cause routing loops) or configure sub interfaces.
				With link state routing protocols, reachability issues may result from DR/BDR election.
				To solve this, spoke routers should never be elected DR/BDR.
		FULL MESH
			Any site can be communicate directly with any other side.
			A large number of virtual circuits have to be configured and maintained, making it the most expensive.
	PROTOCOLS
		FRAME RELAY
		ISDN
			Transmit voice and data over existing phone lines.
		HDLC
			Each vendor that uses HDLC have their own way of identifying the network layer.
			Thus, each vendor's HDLC is proprietary to their own equipment.
			Provides no authentication.
		PPP
			Industry standard protocol that is used to create point to point links between different vendor equipments.
			AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS
				PAP
					Password sent in clear text
					Peer controls authentication attempts
				CHAP
					Hashed passwords are sent across the links
					Local router or external router controls authentication attempts
				COMMANDS
					int x > ppp authentication chap pap
			PPPoE
				COMMANDS
					ip address negotiated
						Configure for PPPoE dialer interface to obtain IP address via PPP/IPCP
					ip address dhcp
						Configure for PPPoE dialer interface to obtain IP address via dhcp
			MULTILINK PPP (MLP)
				Used for load balancing.
				Allows packets to be fragmented and sent simultaneously over mutliple P2P links to same remote address.
				COMMANDS
					interface Multilink1
						ip address x y
						ppp multilink
						ppp multilink group 1
			COMMANDS
				int x > encapsulation ppp
		PPPoE
		Cable
		DSL
		MPLS
		ATM
		VSAT
	TROUBLESHOOTING
		P2P links must have the same encapsulation protocol.
	DCE/DTE
		Router interfaces are typically DTE and they connect to a DCE like a CSU/DSU.
		The CSU/DSU then connects to a demarcation (the point where the ISP responsibility ends).
		*The DCE needs to provide the clock rate to the DTE.
	IPSEC
		Industry framework that allows for secure data transmission over an IP-based(layer 3) network.
		Cannot be used to encrypt non-IP traffic. Have to use a GRE tunnel for non-IP traffic and encrypt that tunnel using IPsec.
		PROTOCOLS
			AUTHENTICATION HEADER (AH)
				Uses a one way hash for packet authentication.
					1. Sender generates a one way hash
					2. Receiver generate same one way hash
					3. If the packet does not match, authentication will be rejected and packet will be dropped.
			ENCAPSULATING SECURITY PAYLOAD (ESP)
				Encrypts an IP packet and encapsulate it as the payload of a new packet.
				Because the entire packet is encrypted, the data payload and header information remains confidential.
				COMPONENTS
					CONFIDENTIALITY (ENCRYPTION)
						Encrypt packets with symmetric encryption algorithms like DES or 3DES. Must be same on both points.
					DATA INTEGRITY
						Uses checksum to verify whether data was altered
					AUTHENTICATION
						Ensure connection is made with correct partner by authenticating source of packet by certifying source of the information.
					ANTI-REPLAY SERVICE
						Sequence number field allows only a unique copy of the packet to reach the destination. (i.e. packet abc reaches on sequence number 1 but dropped on sequence number 2)
					TRAFFIC FLOW
						Tunnel mode.
			HASH-BASED MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION CODE (HMAC)
				A mechanism that uses a hash function to verify the integrity of data trasmitted over a VPN.

EVOLUTION OF INTELLIGENT NETWORKS
	CLOUD COMPUTING
		SERVICE MODELS
			IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
				Provides only the network.
			PaaS (Platform as a Service)
				Provides the operating system and the network. (i.e. Windows Azure)
			SaaS (Software as a Service)
				Common software application such as databases and web servers. (i.e. AWS)
	NETWORK PROGRAMMING
		Currently, routers and switches are devices that are not virtualized. Network programming virtualizes the physical ports of these devices.
		OLD NETWORK
			DATA/FORWARDING PLANE
				Responsible for forwarding frames from its enter/exit interfaces using protocols managed in the control plane
				Data is received, the destination interface is looked up, and the forwarding of frames and packets happens.
				Data plane relies completely on the control plane to provide information.
			CONTROL PLANE
				Responsible for managing and controlling any forwarding table that the data plane uses. (i.e. routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, IPv4, ARP, STP)
		NEW NETWORK
			API
				Software Defined Networking (SDN) manages the network like a WLAN controller manage APs.
				SDN have a central controller managing the devices which provides automatic configuration and remdiation of all devices.
			DATA PLANE
				Contains network elements, meaning physical or virtual devices that deals with data traffic.
			CONTROL PLANE
				A software solution that provides centralized control of the router and switches.
			APPLICATION PLANE
				Applications that communicate their network requirements towards the controller using APIs.
				Application tells the network what to do based on business needs.
			APIC-EM
				Cisco SDN controller that provides centralized automation of policy based application profiles.
				PATH TRACE TOOL
					Allows to examine path of packet from source to destination. Used for ACL analysis.
					When the tool encounters an ACL, it analyzes the entries of the ACL.
					Each ACL is analyzed independently and the trace will not stop if an individual ACL denies traffic.
	QUALITY OF SERVICE
		Used to manage contention for network resources for better UX.
		SHAPING/POLICING TRAFFIC
			SHAPING
				Delaying traffic.
			POLICING
				Dropping traffic.
		IntServ/DiffServ
			BEST-EFFORT DELIVERY
			INTEGRATED SERVICES MODEL
				Uses Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) to create a high-priority path in advance of the transmission.
				Usually used for voice traffic.
				RSVP reserves bandwidth for voice traffic in advance of trasmission.
				Lacks scalability as reserved bandwidth will go up.
			DIFFERENTIATED SERVICES MODEL
				Does not use RSVP for bandwidth reservation like IntServ.
				Allows each router to make separate decision on how to best forward the packet
				The Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) allows prioritization of voice traffic while keeping max bandwidth available to non-priority traffic
		QUEUEING
			FIFO
			WEIGHTED FAIR QUEUEING
				FLOW BASED WFQ
					Default queueing scheme for serial interfaces running at E1 or lower.
					Low volume conversations are queued and sent first and high volume are queued after and sent later.
				DISTRIBUTED WFQ
				DISTRIBUTED CLASS BASED WFQ
				CLASS BASED WFQ
				TAIL DROP
					Drop packets after the queue on the router is full.
				GLOBAL SYNCHRONIZATION
					When packets are dropped because of tail drop, the transmission rate decreases.
					Because transmission rate decreases, bandwidth is underutilized. Transmission rate then increases again.
					This up and down transmission speed is never "just right"
				WEIGHTED RANDOM/RANDOM EARLY DETECTION (WRED/RED)
					Combats global sync by dropping packets before the queue is full.
					WRED drops packets based on "Precedence (IP Prec)" or "Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)"
		TRUST BOUNDARY
			Borders of network whereby packet markings (identify traffic such as voice, data, video) are not trusted.

		ASBR routers connects to a different AS (not area)(i.e. Internet)
	LSA TYPES
		TYPE 1 (ROUTER LINK AD)
			Sent by every router to every other connected router in the area. (i.e. point to point routers)
			If the router is an ABR, then it will send LSAs to all neighbors in all the areas.
			Contains information about its own interfaces as well as adjacent neighbors
		TYPE 2 (NETWORK LINK AD)
			Generated by DRs towards all routers in the same area. (i.e. routers connected to a switch)
			Contains information about the state of the other routers in the same network.
		TYPE 3 (SUMMARY LINK AD)
			Generated by ABRs towards area external to the source (i.e. area 1 > area 0 && area 0 > area 1).
			Contains network information and inter-area routes to the backbone area.
		TYPE 4 (ASBR SUMMARY LSA)
			Generated by ABRs towards the area external to the source (i.e. area 1 > area 0 && area 0 > area 1).
			Similar to summary LSAs like Type 3 but Type 4 is specifically used to inform the rest of the OSPF area how to get to the ASBR.
		TYPE 5 (EXTERNAL LINK/AS AD)
			Generated by ASBR to advertise routes external to the OSPF AS
			A Type 5 LSA is generated for each individual external network advertised by the ASBR
			Flooded everywhere.
